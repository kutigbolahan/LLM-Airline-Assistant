## 📖 Overview

This project demonstrates how **Large Language Models (LLMs)** can simplify travel planning by allowing users to ask questions in plain English such as:

- "What’s the price from Lagos to London?"  
- "Find me the cheapest flight to New York next weekend"  
- "Compare prices for Dubai vs. Paris in December"  

The assistant processes the query, retrieves (or simulates) flight price data, and responds in a conversational manner.
